#Assignment #1 - Pantry Projects
COMP4711 - BCIT - Fall 2016

Here is the list of "pantry" projects to choose from.

Each will be assigned to one group, based on emails sent to me
with your group # and the desired project #.

I will update this list as projects are selected.

Bear in mind that the "data" is suggested data only, i.e. a starting point.
You still need to come up with six (or so) recipes/stock items,
and twelve (or so) pantry inventory items.

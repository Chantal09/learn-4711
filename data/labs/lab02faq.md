#Lab #2 - FAQ
COMP4711 - BCIT - Winter 2017

## How do we test the random quote?

Oops - I forgot to include this in the writeup.

You can test it with the URL <code>quotes.local/welcome/random</code>.

## Are the quote links supposed to work?

The avatars on the homepage seem to have some really random links.
Are we supposed to get those working?

No. Those are planning for a routing exercise a few weeks down the road.
None of the links on the homepage are expected to work - just the homepage
itself.

## Do we need GPG-signing for this lab?

No - that is coming with lab 03.

I would like to see "signed-off by" messages added to the commits.

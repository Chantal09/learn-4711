	<slide title="Changes This Year ..." layout="normal">
		<p>A few things are changing this term, as a result of some 
			Learning Initiative workshops and
			redevelopment over the first half of this year. These have led to some
			rethinking of COMP4711 and how it is presented and delivered...</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Backwards Design</li>
			<li>Flipped Learning</li>
			<li>Flipped LMS</li>
		</ul>
	</slide>

	<slide title="Backwards Design" layout="normal">
		<p>It all starts with the "story" behind the course, and what I want
			you to get out of it ... 
			what you see as the "course goals" in the course outline.</p>        
		<p>Working backwards:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The "story" incorporates the "big picture", and stated as well
				as unstated learning outcomes.</li>
			<li>From this, determine the real-world "evidence", and how an 
				employer would assess your abilities.</li>
			<li>These lead to a clearer expression of the learning outcomes</li>
			<li>... which need suitable assessments (assignments, exams, etc)</li>
			<li>... and which lead to a sequence of instruction</li>
		</ul>
	</slide>

	<slide title="Course Outcomes" layout="normal">
		<p>See the "course goals" section in the course outline.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Build a moderate MVC web application using a suitable framework</li>
			<li>Build distributed capabilities into an MVC web application</li>
			<li>Demonstrate proper team collaboration for webapp development</li>
		</ol>
	</slide>

	<slide title="Flipped Learning" layout="normal">
		<p>Weekly readings will be assigned, starting with the second week, 
			following a "flipped" learning model. </p> 
		<p>You are to read these lessons and answer a quiz/questionnaire, 
			by the evening before that week's "lecture". 
			The "lecture" will address unclear topics, per your feedback, 
			and discuss issues relevant to that week's topics/outcomes.
		</p>
		<p>Yes, you do the "lesson" on your own, and the "homework" during lab.</p>
			
	</slide>

	<slide title="Flipped LMS" layout="normal">
		<p>Desire2Learn (D2L) is a very comprehensive Learning Management System (LMS).</p>
		<p>It is both flexible and inflexible at the same time, and expects content
			to be re-expressed inside its awkward &amp; clunky confines.</p>
		<p>A flipped LMS, on the other hand, lives independently of D2L, and is
			whatever suits the tech-savvyness of the instructor. These are typically
			open-source, flat file driven, and stored/collaborated on, using
			an online repository.</p>

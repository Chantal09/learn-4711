#Week 2 Survey Results

Responses for each of the surveys follow, with the number of similar
responses denoted by a value in brackets, if appropriate.

There were 6-7 responders.

I have interpreted and aggregated results, in hopefully an appropriate fashion.

Version Control	  
			
###What are topics from the lesson that *you* feel need more or better explanation?			

Gitflow conflicts	(3)  
any other issues other then merge conflicts	  
how are these different workflows implemented and enforced in lets say GitHub (Primarily gitflow and forking workflow)	  
Process for merging dev branches	  
The difference between just forking code and cloning code locally.	  
what is devops?	
			
###Are there other, related, questions that you would like addressed in class?			

Are there other commonly used workflows?	  
None of the images were able to be loaded for me so perhaps if there was something important or useful mentioned there I would have missed it.	
			
###Do you have comments or suggestions about the flipped learning process?			

Images for these slides did not work	  
incorporate more images into the rest of the lectures as well and examples

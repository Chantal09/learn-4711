#Week 4 Survey Results

Responses for each of the surveys follow, with the number of similar
responses denoted by a value in brackets, if appropriate.

There were 22-25 responders.

I have interpreted and aggregated results, in hopefully an appropriate fashion.

##WEEK 4 – BASIC ROUTING
			
###What do *you* think the most important takeaways are from this lesson?			

- Basic routing and functions	(12)
- Routing rules	(7)
- Callback routing	(2)
- HTTP verb routing	(2)
- Ability to customizing routing paths	
- codigniter handles lots of this already	
- controller that connects routing between different pages	
- dealing with github	
- Default controller	
- different routing techniques allows flexable routing	
- error routing	
- How controllers handle requests	
- How to override controller convention with routing rules.	
- how to use	
- Regular expressions	
- Routing can get really complicated	
- Routing controller	
- routing is the process of determining how to handle incoming request	
- Routing process	
- Routing with closures	
- Routing with controllers	
- The routing syntax and capabilities	
- The way default routes are handled if no matches are found in the application/controllers.	
- Using regular expressions to redirect a page that fits it's general criteria.	
- We can identify http request verbs, but this is not RESTful (yet)	
- You're able to use regex and call functions directly through routing as well as handling page missing/error 404 stuff.	

There were some off topic ones too:		
- MVC pattern	
- nooooooooooo i hate regex	
- paper handout	
- e-book instructions	
- team work	
	
###What are topics from the lesson that *you* feel need more or better explanation?			

- RESTful	(4)
- regex routing	(3)
- Callback routing	(2)
- HTTP verb routing	(2)
- conventionalregular	
- Default controller	
- Do you need to add routes for a controller index function? In Laravell we would reference the controller in routes, and then it would know about the index function and the other basic crud functions in the controller.	
- Does routing take the top entry as a priority or are all the entries treated equally?	
- Error routing	
- More understanding PHP	
- Perhaps a little more about using arguments in routing, or just some different examples to help understand.	
- Real understanding MVC pattern deeply	
- Routing rules. Specifically multiple routing rules and  how they are handled.	
- Some intruductions are vague	
- various controller configuration	
- what are back references?	
- what are closures?	
- Why are the examples on slide 8 not RESTful? It'll be nice to know why now instead of wk12 so maybe I can read ahead.	
- Why use call-backs instead of going to an end-point directly?	
- why you would use one routing convention compared to another	
	

###Are there other, related, questions that you would like addressed in class?			

- more examples for routing rules	(2)
- Ajax	
- Are there any other routings in CI?	
- does routing other than callback routing has to call method from a controller?	
- how to create a framework by our self	
- maybe give a demo on the basic routing conventions	
- Need to update introduction	
- spelling mistake slide 5 (no space)	
- What are the differences between restful and not restful?	
- What happens after the routing rule rewrites the URL? (how does it know what controller/function to call)	
- What happens if the regular expression fails to match?	
- what's the most efficient way?	
- Why Survey only on Tuesday?	

			
###Do you have comments or suggestions about the flipped learning process?			

- actual demonstration in CI would be appreciated
- Better to give some more days to check up survey. Because, we have 8 classes on Tueday and we have no class for 4711 in the day.
- I would like some real-world examples of when we might need to alter routing. Ideally also when we should not alter it.
- Lecture is not useful. Lecture time could be better utilize to show us examples if the answers to these online questions were to be posted. .
- May we have access to previous term's slides for future weeks? I know you want to edit them to fit flipped learning, but I'm just checking if its a possiblity.
- take examples in the class


##WEEK 4 – ADVANCED ROUTING
			
###What do *you* think the most important takeaways are from this lesson?			

- Hooks and their capabilities	(12)
- Remapping	(8)
- Before using an advanced feature, RTFM!	(2)
- query strings shouldn't be used	(2)
- Remapping can be used for localization.	(2)
- Service routing	(2)
- The steps that CI takes when a request is made.	(2)
- Why use remapping and hooking.	2
- advanced routing can handle all kinds of requests	
- Being able to parse URL on the fly and feed them to methods	
- Loose ends	
- server routing	
- You are able to perform processing before or after certain hook milestones.	
			
###What are topics from the lesson that *you* feel need more or better explanation?			

- Service Routing	(3)
- Usage of hooks and why they're useful.	(3)
- Expand on remaps	
- hooks are events?	
- Hooks. What are some good practices when using one?	
- How hooks work	
- Loose ends	
- more coding examples on "hooks"	
- Regarding API calls, you wrote "but interpretation of the balance of the URI might be supplier-specific". Can you elaborate?	
- Remapping For Localization	
- remapping on the fly	
- Remapping on the fly	
- server routing	
- What are some examples of hook points in use?	
- What is RESTful?	
- What would be a good use for Hooks? An example of what extra processing you could do would be helpful.	
- Why are query strings in the URI discouraged?	
- Why is it so discouraged to use query strings in URIs for codeigniter? Is it because of the possiblity of someone altering it and doing harm to your database?	

			
###Are there other, related, questions that you would like addressed in class?			

- Can you show us some examples of a basic hook?
- demo on the advanced routing techniques?
- how CI service routing is different from other frameworks
- More details on database loose end
- Router and switch
- Slide 3 didn't properly fit on my page and I had to change the view in order to see all the text on the side.
- What are the advantages of using multiple calls to the same hook
- what is RTFM?
- Why are query strings not recommended?
- Why is it bad to use query strings in URIs for CodeIgniter webapps

			
###Do you have comments or suggestions about the flipped learning process?			

- Could you release the survey earlier? The slides were out early this week, since Sunday, but we could not do the survey until Tuesday.
- examples
- The only thing I miss about the traditional model is the lecture. While there is definitely some value in going over the survey feedback during lecture, I feel there should also be time reserved for the lesson itself.
- little more detail on wildcard

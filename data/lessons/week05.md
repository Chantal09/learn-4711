#Week 5 Survey Results

Responses for each of the surveys follow, with the number of similar
responses denoted by a value in brackets, if appropriate.

There were 32-34 responders.

I have interpreted and aggregated some of the results, in hopefully an appropriate fashion.
It was hard, because there were a lot of answers, covering a lot of different
interpretations - that suggests I could do a better job
of preparing the online lesson, so it is more focused.

###Do you have comments or suggestions about the flipped learning process?			

- example demonstration during lab session is helpful
- i like it
- Last lecture much better!!
- More groupwork collaboration
- More illustrations paired with the lecture notes.
- No - but the assignment criteria is MUCH too complicated compared to what we have learned in lectures and labs.
- Some lessons in the lecture is significantly better than no lessons in lecture, please continue it
- The examples were good, hopefully they will be sufficicnt to help me implement them.


##WEEK 5 – MODEL PATTERNS

- Models can be used for more than just representing data relational database tables	
- Models can handle RDB tables without resorting to a model for every table	
- Models for services

###What are topics from the lesson that *you* feel need more or better explanation?			

- Active Record Models	6
- Domain Models	5
- Models for XML	3
- Classic model-view-controller

- the model-view-viewmodel design pattern. what is it?	
- The view supposed to be bound to the model as an event handler, and the models states is supposed to change? What is an example of this?

###Are there other, related, questions that you would like addressed in class?			

- benefits of MVC. why is it so popular?

- Relation between model and controller. Model have access to controllers and controller call models?
- What are the common patterns?

- Which one the MVC pattern should we be using?
- XML

			
###Do you have comments or suggestions about the flipped learning process?			

- Demo of different models
- Most of this slide is theory. I feel like these kinds of surveys should come after the lab so that we have had the chance to better investigate the models, and play with them to get a better understanding for better feedback.
- thorough explanation and examples

**Lab3 Updated** *(Thurs Sept 22, 21:50pm)*
I have made minor corrections to the lab writeup, and added a caution
about Apache redirection.

**Lab 2 marking?** *(Thurs Sept 22, 21:15pm)*
D2L is still having issues with the lab 2 dropboxes :(
I get an internal server error when I try to access them
for marking. Regular grading will resume once access is restored.

**Assignment 1** *(Thurs Sept 22, 13:15pm)*
A draft has been posted in the organizer, and I am looking for feedback.

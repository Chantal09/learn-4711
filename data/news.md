**Week 3** *(Wed Jan 25, 23:30)*  
- I have moved the 'Controllers" lesson to week 4, since we did
not address it this week. 
- I have decided to swap the order of Lab 4 and Assignment 1. I would
like you to hear the controller and routing lessons, and to do the routing lab,
before tackling the first assignment.
- Week 4 content & survey have been enabled

**Labs** *(Wed Jan 25, 08, 21:00)*  
- Lab 2 marking is underway.  
- Lab 3 has been posted, and updated.
  
**GPG Signing** Some of the students are experiencing signing issues - "gpg failed to sign...".  
- Workaround: Until we get that resolved, you may use signed-off by messages, but make sure that 
your username matches your git login. 
- Caution: Be careful that your local and global user 
names and email are the same! 
- Solution? Some of the students were using out-of-date versions of gittool,
and I suggest upgrading to the most recent. Not sure if that will solve
all the problems ... will update this.

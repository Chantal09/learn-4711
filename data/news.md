**Week 6** *(Tue Oct 11, 11:15)*   
The first (of two) online lessons is up.

The second, on forms, will be posted once complete.
The second online lesson will not be ready in a timely fashion, and I won't
count the surveys for it towards marking. I hope you will
still provide feedback, once it is ready, that I can use to improve it
for the next offering. I will leave the survey for this open until
later this week, with a target date chosen in class.

**Lab marking?** *(Thu Oct 6, 20:00)*  
Lab 4 marking in progress.

**Assignment 1** *(Sun Oct 9, 14:00)*  
Assignment FAQ updated.

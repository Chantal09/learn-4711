**Week 4** *(Sun Sept 25, 13:30)*
This week's reading & survey links have been enabled in the organizer :D

**Lab 2 marking?** *(Sat Sept 24, 9:45am)*
D2L is still having issues with the lab 2 dropboxes - not fixed yet :(
I get an internal server error when I try to access them
for marking. Regular grading will resume once access is restored.

**Assignment 1** *(Thurs Sept 22, 13:15pm)*
A draft has been posted in the organizer, and I am looking for feedback.

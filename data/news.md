The survey summary has been posted. See you in class!

I have moved all of the other framework extracts to their own section in the
organizer, and enabled them.

**Labs** *(Tue Jan 24, 09:10)*  
Lab 1 marking is complete. Lab 2 marking has begun.  
Lab 3 has been posted.

**Email Caution** ... if you send an email from inside D2L, it cannot be responded to.
D2L is a notification only service, which tries to look like an email service.
Use your & my real email addresses instead.

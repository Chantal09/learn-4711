**Week 5** *(Tue Feb 07, 08:30)*  
- Survey processed, and a new presentation added :-/
- Assignment 1 posted. Reading it over before lab would be a good idea.
It is a lengthy writeup, as I have erred on the side of caution and completeness.
This assignment isn't super huge, but it is important :-/
My server for this will be up in the next day or two :)

**Labs** *(Sat Feb 04, 08:00)*  
- Lab 2 marking continues.  
- Lab 3 marking is in the queue.
- Lab 4 has concluded.
- No lab this week - assignment 1 instead

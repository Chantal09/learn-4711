**Slack** *(Fri Jan 13, 15:00)*   
Getting more used to Slack; I will be using it to announce course hub updates.  
You can [signup](https://comp4711.slack.com/x-126487566343-127066337221/signup) 
for the "team" if you use a bcit.ca or a my.bcit.ca email address.

**Week 2** *(Wed Jan 18, 20:30)* 
I have started expanding the [FAQ](/display/lesson/faq), in the hope that will help
some of you avoid some pain.

I have added a Lab 2 FAQ in the organizer, with some questions arising in lab.

**Email Caution** ... if you send an email from inside D2L, it cannot be responded to.
D2L is a notification only service, which tries to look like an email service.

**Week 4** *(Sun Jan 29, 09:00)*  
- I have moved the 'Controllers" lesson to week 4, since we did
not address it this week. 
- I have decided to swap the order of Lab 4 and Assignment 1. I would
like you to hear the controller and routing lessons, and to do the routing lab,
before tackling the first assignment.
- Week 4 content & survey have been enabled
- I have moved the FAQ to its own section in the organizer, and broken it
down into individual parts.

**Labs** *(Wed Jan 25, 08, 21:00)*  
- Lab 2 marking is underway.  
- Lab 3 has been posted, and updated.

- Readings & surveys posted; the surveys close Monday 9pm
- Assignment 1 posted. Reading it over before lab would be a good idea.
It is a lengthy writeup, as I have erred on the side of caution and completeness.
This assignment isn't super huge, but it is important :-/
My server for this will be up in the next day or two :)

- Lab 2 marking continues.

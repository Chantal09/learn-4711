**Week 4** *(Tue Jan 30, 08:30)*  
- Survey results posted & lesson adjusted. 
- I have decided to swap the order of Lab 4 and Assignment 1. I would
like you to hear the controller and routing lessons, and to do the routing lab,
before tackling the first assignment.

**Labs** *(Tue Jan 30, 11:00)*  
- Lab 2 marking continues.  
- Lab 3 marking is in the queue.
- Lab 4 is ready for you :)

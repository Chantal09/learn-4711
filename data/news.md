**Week 12** *(Fri Nov 25, 03:00)*   
Lesson for this week posted, as was the survey summary.  
REST example repos updated.  
Lab 9 (last one!) posted..

Fixed the tutorial for this week, by adding better explanation to the package-restful
readme file, and to the tutorial writeup.

**Survey** (Wed Nov 16 13:00)
I have posted a new survey on D2L, [Planning Ahead](https://learn.bcit.ca//d2l/lms/survey/user/attempt/survey_start_frame.d2l?si=261919&ou=335696)  
It is anonymous, and solicits feedback about the course hub and flipped learning, for this and for other courses.
It is open until Nov 30th.

**Assignments** *(Thu Nov 24, 15:30)*  
Assignment 1 marking continues.  
Assignment 2 posted. Please let me know of any questions or issues with it.

**Exams** *(Mon Nov 21)*  
Got your attention! I have posted last term's midterm and final exams on D2L,
in the content section. I used D2L for them to ensure limited distribution.  
I have not decided the makeup or style of our final exam yet ... this will
probably come up a few times over the new 3 weeks.

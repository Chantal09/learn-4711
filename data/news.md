**Lab 2 update** *(Fri Sept 17, 7:30am)*
I have added a more in-depth explanation of synching to the lab
writeup. It does not change process or deliverables, but will
hopefully help you understand better what/why/when you "do"
synching.

I have also sorted out & published the rubric :)

**Lab 2 is ready** *(Thur Sept 15, 12:30pm)*  
See you in lab!

**Lab 2 is ready** *(Thur Sept 15, 12:30pm)*  
See you in lab!  
Er, it is almost ready ... I haven't setup the rubric yet. Will do so this evening.  

The "upstream" alias for synch'ing could use better guidance - see the "dev02" story for an example.
Basically, add a remote alias, "upstream", for your team repo, and use that for synch'ing.

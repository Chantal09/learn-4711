**Week 3** *(Wed Jan 25, 08:30)*  
- The survey summary has been posted. See you in class!
- I have moved all of the other framework extracts to their own section in the
organizer, and enabled them.
- I have added a "Marking" post, in the reference section below.
You might find it interesting :-/
- I have moved the 'Controllers" lesson to next week, since we did
not address it this week. The "Routing" lesson(s) may need adjusting too.

**Labs** *(Wed Jan 25, 08, 11:40)*  
- Lab 1 marking is complete. 
- Lab 2 marking has begun.  
- Lab 3 has been posted. In fact, it has been updated - fixed a couple of typos
and elaborated a bit on signing and setting up your MYSQL database 
  
**GPG Signing** Some of the students are experiencing signing issues - "gpg failed to sign...".  
- Workaround: Until we get that resolved, you may use signed-off by messages, but make sure that 
your username matches your git login. 
- Caution: Be careful that your local and global user 
names and email are the same! 
- Solution? Some of the students were using out-of-date versions of gittool,
and I suggest upgrading to the most recent. Not sure if that will solve
all the problems ... will update this.

**Email Cautions** 
- If you send an email from inside D2L, it cannot be responded to.
D2L is a notification only service, which tries to look like an email service.
Use your & my real email addresses instead.
- If you encounter a problem with your lab, and I ask you to email
me a zip of the project folder (so we don't mess up your repo) and of
your Apache config, the institute email server is likely to remove the zip
attachments, for security :( Workaround - make them, put them in a dropbox, and
include the dropbox link in your email.

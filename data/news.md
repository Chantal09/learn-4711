**Slack** *(Fri Jan 13, 15:00)*   
Getting more used to Slack; I will be using it to announce course hub updates.  
You can [signup](https://comp4711.slack.com/x-126487566343-127066337221/signup) 
for the "team" if you use a bcit.ca or a my.bcit.ca email address.

**Week 2** *(Sat Jan 14, 09:00)*  
There are two simple lessons for this week, each addressing a cornerstone of the course.
Each has a "do this" icon, indicating that you should read that lesson (in either
slideshow or print-friendly format) and answer the corresponding survey.  
The day before lecture, I will review the survey submissions, and either address
questions in feedback linked to in the organizer, or I might adjust the lesson
before class.  
This is your chance to help make the material more relevant and clear for you!

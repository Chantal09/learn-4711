**Slack** *(Fri Jan 13, 15:00)*   
Getting more used to Slack; I will be using it to announce course hub updates.  
You can [signup](https://comp4711.slack.com/x-126487566343-127066337221/signup) 
for the "team" if you use a bcit.ca or a my.bcit.ca email address.

**Week 2** *(Tue Jan 17, 11:30)*  
There are two simple lessons for this week, each addressing a cornerstone of the course.
I have updated the lecture based on your feedback, flagging or updating the less clear areas.

This week's lab has also been vetted.

**Email Caution** ... if you send an email from inside D2L, it cannot be responded to.
D2L is a notification only service, which tries to look like an email service.

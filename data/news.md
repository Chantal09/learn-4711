**Week 3** *(Tue Jan 24, 09:30)*  
- The survey summary has been posted. See you in class!
- I have moved all of the other framework extracts to their own section in the
organizer, and enabled them.
- I have added a "Marking" post, in the reference section below.
You might find it interesting :-/
- I have moved the 'Controllers" lesson to next week, since we did
not address it this week. The "Routing" lesson(s) may need adjusting too.

**Labs** *(Tue Jan 24, 09:10)*  
- Lab 1 marking is complete. 
- Lab 2 marking has begun.  
- Lab 3 has been posted. In fact, it has been updated - fixed a couple of typos
and elaborated a bit on signing and setting up your MYSQL database 

**Email Cautions** 
- If you send an email from inside D2L, it cannot be responded to.
D2L is a notification only service, which tries to look like an email service.
Use your & my real email addresses instead.
- If you encounter a problem with your lab, and I ask you to email
me a zip of the project folder (so we don't mess up your repo) and of
your Apache config, the institute email server is likely to remove the zip
attachments, for security :( Workaround - make them, put them in a dropbox, and
include the dropbox link in your email.

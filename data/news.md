**Online Lessons Ready** *(Mon Sept 12, 6pm)*  
Ok - the online lessons are finally ready. In week 2, you see them with a pointing finger
icon on the left, and with a link to the corresponding D2L survey on the right.
There are three short lessons for this week, and a 1 page survey is expected for each.
Please complete these before 7pm Tuesday evening, thank you.

**Slow Progress** *(Mon Sept 12)*  
I underestimated the time to refactor the presentations for online learning,
and am still working on this week's.
I did suggest that I would be a guinea pig too, and am paying the price!

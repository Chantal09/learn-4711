**Week 10** *(Wed Nov 9, 09:30)*   
Very sorry for the delay, but first lesson posted.  

I have enabled the survey, and will keep it open until tomorrow,
for those of you with questions that don't get addressed in lecture.
Completing the survey is not expected, and not for marks.

**4c**: Friday is a stat, so no lab. Makeup Thursday 15:30-17:20,
with 4R in SE12-319. It will be tight, but some of that set sit in on 4D's
lab the previous two hours. We will make it work :-/

**All**: Reducing the number and scope of the assignments, to afford more depth
than breadth. Details in lecture :)

**Assignments** *(Wed Nov 9, 09:30)*  
Assignment 1 marking continues.  
Assignment 2 will be posted when ready.

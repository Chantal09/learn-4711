**Week 7** *(Wed Oct 19, 02:30)*   
This week's lab is ready.  
The forms handling lessons has been posted.

**Assignment 1** *(Tue Oct 18, 15:00)*  
First pass done, and I made a gallery of the homepages.  
Some look great, and some have case sensitivity issues :-/  
Any corrections or changes are to be done in your develop branch,
and not in your master branch, which I am using for marking!
